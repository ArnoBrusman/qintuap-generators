Messed a bit with the ModelMakeCommand to see what I could do with it.
Created the admake:model command that creates the most basic outlining for a model.
Inherit functionality for the generation commands are very basic, but they are a good 
base for future expansion, if a more function code generation options don't present themselves.

Other commands were only directly copied for future use. 


-- edit:
Found an extention of it from bpocallaghan. Still fairly basic, but an extention none the less.
My first personal extention on it would likely be to make what is replaced more malleable.
